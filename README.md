# Cookie Conset block easy list
This is an easylist compatible file which blocks all elements related to cookie consents. I will build this list out manually.

I have no intention of helping anyone. Try at your own risk. If it works for you, great

## How to use
1. Open `uBlock Origin` extention settings
2. Got to `Filter Lists` tab
3. At the bottom of the page you will see an option of adding custom lists, click on import checkbox and add the following url
```
